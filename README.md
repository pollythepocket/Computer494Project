#To Export:

    In order to export (or sync) the new json file from labelbox, you have to go to "Data Rows", click "Done", then select "All", then "Export data v2", then click "include label details", then "export JSON". The export will be in notifications. You can download from there and just copy and paste in from the existing .json file (DON'T EDIT THE settings.json file LOL).

    (Also, if you don't see your work in the "done" section, that menas it was not approved. I don't know why it does this, but you have to manually accept them all after you annotate)
